# Makefile Reference

The Makefile is for **local development and pre-release verification**. Every Docker target builds from your local checkout. End users install via `curl | bash` and run `decepticon` — they don't use `make`.

Run `make help` for a quick summary. Full reference below.

## Pre-release Verification

The primary purpose of this Makefile. Run these before tagging a release.

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make dogfood` | Full OSS UX on local code: builds the Go launcher + every service image (`:dev` tag), wires up an isolated `$DECEPTICON_HOME` under `.dogfood/`, then runs the launcher. The onboard wizard, engagement picker, `compose up`, health checks, and CLI all execute exactly as a `curl \| bash` install. |
| `make smoke` | Compose-only smoke (no launcher, no onboard wizard) — fastest possible release-shape check. Replicates only the launcher's `compose up` step: clean → build images locally → `up -d --no-build --wait` → health checks. Use when you only changed the compose stack. |
| `make launcher` | Build the Go launcher binary at `clients/launcher/bin/decepticon`. Embedded version is `dev`, which skips release update notices and versioned config sync inside the launcher. Invoked automatically by `make dogfood`. |

`make dogfood` runs against an isolated `.dogfood/` directory so the user's real `~/.decepticon` is never touched. `make clean` purges both the compose volumes and `.dogfood/` when you want a fresh onboard.

## Development

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make dev` | Build all Docker images and start with hot-reload (`docker compose watch`) — source changes sync into containers automatically |
| `make cli-dev` | Open the interactive terminal UI locally with hot-reload (Node) — backend stays in Docker |
| `make web-dev` | Run the Next.js dev server locally with infra services in Docker |

Typical contributor workflow:

```bash
# Day-to-day iteration: hot-reload
make dev

# Before opening a PR
make quality

# Before tagging a release
make smoke      # fast check
make dogfood    # full OSS UX
```

The Web dashboard is part of the default Compose stack; after `make dev` it's reachable at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Quality Gates

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make quality` | Run all quality gates: Python lint + tests + CLI typecheck/build/test + Web lint/build |
| `make lint` | Python lint + type-check (`ruff check` + `ruff format --check` + `basedpyright`) |
| `make lint-fix` | Auto-fix Python lint and formatting |
| `make quality-cli` | CLI typecheck + build + test (`vitest`) |

---

## Testing

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make test [ARGS=...]` | Run Python tests (`pytest`) inside the Docker container |
| `make test-local [ARGS=...]` | Run Python tests locally (requires `uv sync --dev`) |

CLI tests are part of `make quality-cli`. To run them in isolation: `npm run test --workspace=@decepticon/cli`.

---

## Web Dashboard

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make web-dev` | Start the Next.js dev server locally; brings up infra in Docker |
| `make web-build` | Build the web dashboard (also generates the Prisma client) |
| `make web-lint` | Lint the web dashboard (ESLint) |
| `make web-migrate [NAME=name]` | Run a Prisma dev migration |
| `make web-ee` | Link the Enterprise Edition package (`@decepticon/ee`) — dev-only, not part of the OSS flow |
| `make web-oss` | Unlink the EE package — revert to OSS mode |

To regenerate just the Prisma client (without a full build): `cd clients/web && npx prisma generate`.

---

## Operations

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make status` | Show running service status (`docker compose ps`) |
| `make logs [SVC=service]` | Follow logs (default: `langgraph`). Override: `make logs SVC=litellm` |
| `make health` | KG backend + Neo4j + Web health checks (broader than `decepticon kg-health`, which only checks the KG) |
| `make clean` | Full teardown: stop services, remove volumes, **and remove `.dogfood/`**. Use this when you want the next `make dogfood` to start from a fresh onboard wizard. |

---

## Benchmark

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make benchmark [ARGS="--level 1"]` | Run the benchmark suite locally |

---

## Versioning (no manual step)

There is no `make sync-version` or pre-tag commit. Source-tree version fields carry a `"0.0.0"` sentinel in `pyproject.toml`, `clients/cli/package.json`, and `clients/web/package.json`. The release workflow stamps the real tag into the images at Docker build time via `--build-arg VERSION=<tag>`. The Go launcher is similarly stamped via GoReleaser ldflags.

Release channel policy:

- `vX.Y.Z` Git tags are the source of truth for stable releases.
- GHCR version tags (`X.Y.Z`) are immutable release artifacts and should be used by installed deployments.
- GHCR `latest` is a moving pointer to the newest fully verified stable release only. It is promoted after all version-tagged images exist and the GitHub release is undrafted.
- Pre-releases should use SemVer suffixes such as `v1.1.0-rc.1`, stay marked as GitHub pre-releases, and should not move `latest`.
- Bug fixes ship as new patch releases. Do not rebuild or rewrite an existing version tag.

To cut a release:

```bash
make quality && make smoke && make dogfood
git tag v1.0.16 && git push origin v1.0.16
```
