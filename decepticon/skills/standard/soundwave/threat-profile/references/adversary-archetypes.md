# Adversary Archetypes

Pre-built threat profiles for common engagement scenarios. Copy the relevant archetype and customize for your specific engagement.

## Tier 1: Opportunistic Attacker

```json
{
  "name": "Opportunistic External Attacker",
  "sophistication": "low",
  "motivation": "financial",
  "initial_access": ["T1190", "T1110", "T1595.002"],

```

**Behavioral Profile:**
- Spearphishing, credential stuffing, access brokers
- Dwell time: days to weeks
- Tools: Cobalt Strike, custom phishing kits, commodity malware

    "T1195.002",
    "T1059.001",

    "T1069.002"
  ]
}
```

**Behavioral Profile:**
- 0-day exploits, supply chain, long-term social engineering
- Dwell time: months to years
- Tools: Custom implants, living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), firmware-level persistence
- Heavy use of legitimate admin tools to blend in
- Multi-stage operations with careful OPSEC

## Tier 4: Insider Threat

```json
{
  "name": "Malicious Insider",

**Behavioral Profile:**
- Already has legitimate access — no need for initial compromise

- Tools: Standard corporate tools, USB drives, personal cloud storage
- Focuses on data access and exfiltration over persistence
- May escalate privileges if current access is insufficient
