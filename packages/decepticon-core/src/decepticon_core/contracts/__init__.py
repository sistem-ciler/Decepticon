"""Plugin contracts — the surface plugin authors implement against.

Submodules:

  * ``slots`` — middleware slot enum and per-role applicability mapping.
    Was ``decepticon.agents.middleware_slots``; framework keeps the
    default factory helpers (which need langchain runtime) and imports
    the enum/constants from here.

Future Phase 1 commits will add ``contributions`` (ToolContribution,
MiddlewareContribution, PromptContribution, SubAgentContribution,
SafetyDeclaration) and ``PluginBundle`` proper (currently lives at
``decepticon_core.plugin_loader`` after Phase 1.B).
