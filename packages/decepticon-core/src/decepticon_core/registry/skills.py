"""Skill source registry — path validation + collision detection.

Closes gap §8 #12 from the consumption audit: plugin-registered
``/skills/<bundle>/`` paths used to be silently accepted even when
malformed (``/workspace/foo``) or duplicated. ``SkillSourceRegistry``
validates format at registration time and emits a
``PluginConflictWarning`` when two owners register the same path.
